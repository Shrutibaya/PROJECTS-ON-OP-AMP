#ðŸ”¥ Fire Alarm Using Op-Amp
---
This project is a basic fire alarm system using an op-amp (IC 741) as a comparator and a thermistor as a temperature sensor. When the temperature crosses a set threshold, the op-amp triggers a buzzer alert. The circuit is simple, low-cost, and useful for homes or industrial safety. Designed using basic electronic components on a breadboard.
